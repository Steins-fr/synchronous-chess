# Room Manager Layer

## Build

Run `yarn build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. 

## Development server

It is difficult to host locally a lambda layer that mimic AWS services. So prefer deploying the app to a AWS development environment with terraform.
